# Front End Style Guides

## ESLINT

We use it because it does everything we want, is fast, and forward-thinking.

### Purpose

To help software engineers differentiate JavaScript from their usual server-side language.
Help teach how JavaScript works too.
So no semicolons at ends of lines.
All the vars must be at the top of their respective functions.
Style considerations, like camelCase because native JavaScript is. This also helps differentiate JavaScript from Ruby.
A lot of thought has gone into this. See the comments in [.eslintrc](.eslintrc)

### Ignores

Minified files, with .min.js suffix.
CoffeeScript and TypeScript source files.
JSON files too.
